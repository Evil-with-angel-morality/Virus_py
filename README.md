# Virus_py
This is a Python file for learning and do not run this file on your system at all !! If you do this, the consequences are up to you !!!

# What does this virus do?
1_Changes the system password

2_Disables Windows or the operating system

3_Formats drive C.

4_Opens a photo too many times

5_Executes a large number of (b .py) files, which (b .py) also executes this script

6_It fills the graphics card and causes it to hang and crash

7_Turns off the device so that it no longer turns on!

8_And...


# How do I get viruses to my target and execute it?
First send the folder (Virus) to your target and tell it to run the script (start virus .py). And wait for her to cry! :)

Note that you must send or open the contents of the folder (Virus) without change.



# What if our goal is not Python?

Go to the folder code (start virus .py) and in line 24 of this code change this os.startfile ("b.py") to this code os.startfile ("X .exe")
And you have to change the folder (b.py) to the .exe file and rename it to X.
And convert the file (start virus .py) to a file (S.exe).

The next way

Go to the folder code (start virus .py) and delete on line 24
Delete the folder (b.py)
Convert the folder (start virus .py) to a file (S.exe). (This will reduce the virus power)



There are other ways you can edit a virus file with a little thought.
